To install Service Monitor, run

  plasmapkg -i /path/to/service-monitor

then add the widget in KDE. If you want to remove it again, run

  plasmapkg -r service-monitor

Please note: the master branch is used for development and can contain a tempo-
rarily broken version. Switch to a release branch for a working version.

For development, you can use plasmoidviewer to quickly start the widget from
command line. This way you don't have to install/uninstall all the time.
